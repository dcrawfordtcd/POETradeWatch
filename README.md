# POETradeWatch
Trying out NetBeans GUI creator, not entirely happy with the code but it works pretty well!
This program automatically searches for items listed for trade on poe.trade, e.g., http://poe.trade/search/isikitosikatar
Put the search hash (last section of URL) into a box on the left, add a description and hit search.
This program will run every search once every 5 min (to avoid overloading poe.trade!) 
and play an audio alert if the number of results increases. (ie, something new for sale!)
Press the buttons on the right to immediately open that search in your browser.
Enjoy and don't misuse it! :)
